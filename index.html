          Organic, Seasonal Fruit of Your Choice***
        </li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One large (8 quart) steel or aluminum pot</li>
      <li>One 6 quart glass container, with no lid</li>
      <li>One thin towel, or cheesecloth</li>
      <li>One large rubber band or string</li>
      <li>One medium size strainer</li>
      <li>5-6 1 quart glass bottles</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
      Bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil. Make sure the pot is not lined with teflon or anything but aluminum or steel.
      </li>
      <li>
      Reduce to a simmer and put sugar in the water. Stir until completely dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
      Once sugar is dissolved, put tea leaves in the hot, sugary water and let mixture sit until room temperature (sometimes this is all day, or overnight). 
      </li>
      <li>
      Before handling anything further, make sure that you have washed your hands, all utensils, and that the glass container to hold the brew is well-sterilized. This is because the SCOBY picks up ALL bacteria--good and bad--and anything bad will eventually end up amplified and in your system.
      </li>
      <li>
      Pour the tea mixture through a strainer, straining out the tea leaves, into the 6 quart glass container. Place the SCOBY in the mixture and cover with a light, porous towel or cheesecloth. Fix the towel or cheesecloth with a string or rubber band.  Leave the mixture to brew 7-10 days at room temperature.  
      </li>
      <li>
      After this "first fermentation", fill the bottoms of 5-6 1 quart glass bottles with 1/4-1/2 cup of seasonal, organic fruit of your choice (antioxidants are a great option!), seal them, and let them brew for another 3-5 days. This is the "second fermentation."
    </ol>
    Pro tip: Try to open the bottles once a day to let some of the pressure out. Otherwise you may end up with a splattered kitchen when you go to open and drink your brew. I know this from personal experience...many times over!

<p>* Because komucha is contains live cultures that feed on whatever they come in contact with, it's important to make sure you choose the purest ingredients possible. GMO products frequently have been propogated with glyphosate, which is connected with many different kinds of ailments and disease. </p>
<p>** You can get a SCOBY locally, online, or from a friend. Make sure you handle it carefully and clean everything that will touch it well!</p>
<p>*** Again, organic is important here because fruit crops tend to get a lot of pesticides--particularly those on the <a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty-dozen.php">Dirty Dozen</a> list. If you'd rather not spend the extra cash on organic fruit, stick to fruits on the <a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/clean-fifteen.php">Clean Fifteen</a> list.
